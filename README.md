# CD-Nozzle
This project is about numerical solution of Flow through CD nozzle using van-Leer Flux vector splitting method.

# Follow the following procedure to execute the code

1. The file format is .py
2. Install the numpy library, scipy library and matplotlib library in your python interpreter(VS Code) before running it.
3. Load  the python file in the interpreter and run it. Select run without debugging option and then select python debugger.
4  You can also just double click it, which will open the python file in Vs code. Run  the file by selecting  run without debugging option and then select python debugger.
5. In case of  Google collab , copy and paste the code  and then run it.
6. The code will generate pressure ratio vs x-location and Mach number vs x-location curve
7. The code will generate various results in term terms of pressure ratio, Mach number and cross-sectional area at various location.
